# Super Duper Boss Fight V2 (SmallBasic)
The most recent and currently evolving entry in a series of "tank shooter" video games made using the graphical capabilities of Microsoft SmallBasic.

## How to Run
For this program to run, it is highly recommended that it is run using Microsoft SmallBasic as it is unknown how it will run otherwise. Optimization was accounted for to some extent but the game has not been tested on other devices, meaning fluency and stability are not a guarantee.

## Gameplay

This game is similar to SDBF V1 in many ways but is still in development.  
  
Here is a list of the currently functional features present:  
* A cinematic intro sequence with the main enemy  
* Adequate player movement with acceleration and deceleration  
* Ability to aim turret  
* Ability to fire and hit enemies  
* A boss enemy which independantly moves around the screen for the player to shoot at  
* Saw projectiles spawned by the boss that target the player using unusual methods (do not accelerate towards the player but change their direction by a given angle to face the player every time they bounce off of a wall, making them both difficult to dodge and unpredictable)  
* Ability to shoot saw projectiles and change their direction as self-defense (a rigid body collision, in essence)  
  
Features which will hopefully be added in the future include but are not limited to:  
* Player health and a death sequence  
* The ability to retry  
* Boss health  
* Many phases with different projectiles and attacks  
  * Saw phase pt.2 where the boss directly chases the player as a giant saw  
  * Square phase where the boss spawns square projectiles that can only move in cardinal directions  
  * Square phase pt.2 where the boss becomes a giant square  
  * Triangle phase where the boss spawns spinning triangle which explode into smaller projectiles in close proximity  
  * Triangle phase pt.2 where the boss becomes a "drill" that crashes into walls, releasing projectiles  
  * Line phase with something to do with lazers (same math as player shots)
  * Final phase with the boss in the middle, releasing lots of lazers and projectiles  
* A proper victory sequence  
  
Features which are unlikely to be added but are very cool:  
* A title screen  
* Music and sound effects  
* A "perfect" ending for not getting hit  
* Difficulty settings that alter existing variables  
* Special attack(s) / ability(ies)  


### Issues

The speed of the game is likely determined by the processing power of the device it is run on though this has not been tested.
